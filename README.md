# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Exortile! I'm currently mostly a recreational programmer, specializing in reverse engineering and low-level stuff. My journey started by starting to tinker around trying to mod the GameCube version of Sonic Riders, which by today, I have learned and reverse engineered the game a lot, since 2020. This taught me how to work with the PowerPC architecture in Assembly early on, from which I extended my skillset outwards to try other things as well and towards higher level languages, slowly taking on C, then C++, and so on.

## Current projects ðŸ”­

- [Sonic Riders Tournament Edition](https://github.com/RidersBoulevard/sonicriderste): Currently the biggest project I've been working on yet, since 2020, as also mentioned in the entry paragraph. This repository lists the public source code of the mod.
- [Riders Toolkit](https://github.com/Exortile/riders-toolkit): This project is also Sonic Riders related. This is a centralized toolkit for working with the game.
- [Sonic Riders Blender Exporter Plugin](https://github.com/Sonic-Riders-Tournament-Edition/sega-nn-gno-exporter): A Blender plugin to deal with some of the files that determine the visual aspects of the game, like 3D models and animations.

## Completed projects âœ…

- [NewsFlash](https://github.com/Exortile/news-flash): A relatively simple webpage, centralizing multiple Estonian news sources into one place. This was a school project, so the README is in Estonian.
- [Audio Based Learning](https://github.com/einsoktlu/audiobasedlearning): A simple Android app, designed to automate listening to work instructions by using voice recognition. This was a school project, so most of it is in Estonian.
- [gcaxdtpk](https://github.com/Exortile/gcaxdtpk): This tool deals with the soundbanks containing audio files in Sonic Riders (exporting and importing).
- [gvrtex](https://github.com/Exortile/gvrtex): A Rust library for encoding and decoding a specific image format, used on the GameCube and Wii.

## Currently learning ðŸŒ±

The main thing I have an interest in and I'm learning currently is graphics programming and compiler development. Currently, I'm focusing on learning graphics programming, so I'm working on trying to create a game engine for the GameCube in [this repository](https://github.com/Exortile/VelvetEngine), along with a [Blender plugin](https://github.com/Exortile/VelvetEngineTools) to interface with some of the other parts of the engine.
